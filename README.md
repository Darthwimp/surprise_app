# surprise_app

This app has been built to troll people by rickrolling them <3



## build_number=1
For this build, the app has 3 pages in total, them being, the splash page, the button page and, the surprise page.
This is the very first build of the app and it is not optimized at all.
It has the following bugs:-
    1. If the user presses backbutton, the app navigates back to the previous pages.
    2. After navigating to the previous page, if the user presses the button again and again, the song keeps layering.
    3. The splash pages doesn't show up instantly, it has a black screen for like a few miliseconds before it loads up.
    4. After pressing the home button and going back to the homepage, the song keeps playing.
